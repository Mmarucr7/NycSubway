# NYC Subway Pathfinder

A React + TypeScript application that finds the fastest route between NYC subway stations using Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Features

- **Interactive NYC Subway Map**: Visual representation of the NYC subway system with real geographic coordinates
- **Quickest Route Calculation**: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the fastest path between any two stations
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Shows the quickest route directly on the map with color-coded subway lines
- **Detailed Route Information**: Step-by-step directions, total time, and transfer information
- **Smart Route Planning**: Accounts for wait times at transfer stations and travel times between stations
- **Station Filtering**: Search stations by name or filter by subway line

## How It Works

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: The application uses a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm that accounts for not just distance between stations, but also:
   - Travel time between stations
   - Wait time when transferring between lines
   - Number of transfers

2. **Data Model**: The subway system is represented as a graph where:
   - Nodes are subway stations with properties (name, lines, wait time, coordinates)
   - Edges are connections between stations with properties (line, travel time)

3. **Route Calculation**: When selecting a start and end station, the algorithm:
   - Finds the optimal path by minimizing total travel time
   - Includes transfer wait times in the calculation
   - Returns detailed information about the route including transfers and timing

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Google Maps API**: For interactive mapping
- **Vite**: Fast build tooling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm or yarn
- Google Maps API key with Maps JavaScript API enabled

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/subway-pathfinder.git
cd subway-pathfinder
```

2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your Google Maps API key to the `.env` file
```
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
```

4. Start the development server
```
npm run dev
```

5. Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

### Environment Variables

The application requires the following environment variables to function properly:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY | Google Maps API key with Maps JavaScript API enabled | Yes |

For more information about getting a Google Maps API key, visit the [Google Maps Platform documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

## Future Enhancements

- Add real-time subway status information
- Include more detailed subway data with all NYC stations
- Implement alternative routing options (fewer transfers, less walking)
- Add accessibility information for stations
- Include walking directions to and from stations
